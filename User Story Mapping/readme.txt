Thought Process:

My focus was on making the app easy, versatile and easy for users. I tried to think about the needs of different types of user and wanted to think from their point of view what they might look for when buying groceries through an app. Through some brainstorming session, I have come to the decision that an easy sign up process, different payment options, delivery tracking option so that the user can have a stress free experience, return/cancel opportunity and most importantly search item by category or just by entering the name of product which takes minimum effort and less time can make the app appealing to the users. However, I also think to make the app more popular, it should be updated more frequently. Keeping that in mind, I have also created a update price and update availability option that are only available for the developers.

Decisions:

1. Adding Multiple Payment Option:
I have added multiple payment system such as credit, debit and most importantly cash on delivery system considering the people who like to have an old school feel and track money. Inside the "Payment Info" section, upon using the credit/debit card information, name, billing address, a new page will open where the user can choose how they want to pay.
2. Real-Time Delivery Tracking:
Real time tracking builds trust and make the service more stress free. It also gives the user a sense of happiness when they get "Your 	order is on the way". In broad scale, this dopamine release might force the user to order more. Users can find it inside the "Track your order" section. There will be a space where the user have to input the tracking ID which they will receive through email after placing order.
3. AI Chatbot:
Sometimes it can be tedious to wait for a customer service call to be picked up. To make it less frustrating, I decided to add an AI chatbot that can quickly answer customers' basic inquiries. Users will find the chatbot in the bottom-right corner of the app. A mini notification saying "Chat with me for quick help" will pop up every time the user opens the app.

Extra Features That I have tried:
1. Created different personas.
2. Tried to use the timeline feature.
3. Used the annotation feature. For the tasks that I think I need more information, I have used the "Need discussion" mark
and for the task that seems hard, I have used "Splitable"
